Task: Analyze the following brain tumor segmentation metrics and produce a comprehensive JSON report.

Analysis Requirements:

1. For each patient, provide:
   - Numerical summary (WT/TC/ET volumes + centroid coordinates)
   - Clinical decision (tumor_probable | tumor_possible | no_tumor_detected)
   - Brief rationale (1-3 sentences)
   - Complete Markdown report (report_md) ready for PDF conversion

2. Decision Rules:
   - tumor_probable: if WT>0 AND (TC>0 OR ET>0)
   - tumor_possible: if WT>0 AND TC=0 AND ET=0
   - no_tumor_detected: if WT=0 (therefore TC=ET=0)

3. Important Notes:
   - Volumes < 0.05 mL are highly sensitive to noise → mention in notes
   - asymmetry_index = -1.0 may be a sentinel value (not calculated) → flag it

4. JSON Format Requirements:
   - ALWAYS wrap your response in ```json and ``` markers
   - Escape all special characters in strings (backslashes, quotes, newlines)
   - For report_md field: use \\n for newlines, \\" for quotes, \\\\ for backslashes
   - Ensure all JSON is properly formatted and valid

5. Output Format (strict JSON schema):

```json
[
  {
    "patient": "string",
    "metrics": {
      "WT_mL": 0.0,
      "TC_mL": 0.0,
      "ET_mL": 0.0,
      "centroid_mm": {"x": 0.0, "y": 0.0, "z": 0.0},
      "notes": ["string", "..."]
    },
    "decision": "tumor_probable | tumor_possible | no_tumor_detected",
    "rationale": "string (1-3 sentences, concise)",
    "disclaimer": "string",
    "report_md": "string (complete Markdown with proper JSON escaping)"
  }
]
```

6. Requirements for report_md:
   - Use Markdown headings (#, ##), tables, and bullet points
   - Professional style suitable for PDF export
   - Include: header (patient, date, study), KPIs, volume table, centroid position, 
     decision & rationale, limitations, glossary
   - No external links or images
   - IMPORTANT: Properly escape all special characters for JSON (newlines as \\n, quotes as \\", backslashes as \\\\)
